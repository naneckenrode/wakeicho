                            <p>20 май 2015  Собственно, нашел плагин "Datho VPN" (https://www.dathovpn.com/download- vpn-software.html), позволяющий прямо из KODI запустить. So I signed up for a datho vpn account and successfully configured the add-on in xbmc. It gave me a message about what my ip address was once I connected to the server. How do I test that my isp is in fact seeing this ip address? In other words how do I know I'm being anonymous in xbmc? Is the message from the add on sufficient? I'd I look in settings at my up address I see my usual ip not what the datho vpn add on reported. 7 июл 2015  Сеть Datho VPN состоит из более чем 70 серверов в 17 странах с неограниченным трафиком P2P. В бесплатной версии ограничена. We are extremely pleased to announce a new VPN service designed with the cord cutter in mind – Datho VPN ( I am making our very first public announcement here on /r/cordcutters, because this is where I first came when I decided to ditch cable about a year-and-a-half ago and wanted to know what my options were. Like most people who come here; I was fed-up with my provider and their 0+/m. Безопасное подключение к сайтам и Wi-Fi. Обход блокировок контента. Защита от слежки в сети. VPN для ПК и других устройств бесплатно. My friend has really scared the hell out of me by constantly warning me that I will get caught streaming content directly from torrent sites if I don't use a VPN. So, I came across the only VPN addon for Kodi and that's Datho VPN. I want to know how many of you are actually using it? And if it's really that necessary. We are extremely pleased to announce the official release of Datho VPN ( – The first personal VPN service with its own add-on for Kodi (XBMC). Datho VPN offers over 70 servers in 17 countries in Asia, Europe, North & South America and Oceania. Our servers are hosted on a tier-1 network, with many clocking in at 20mbps down – more than adequate for streaming full HD. With the Datho. I need help. I am new to osmc on my raspberry pi 3. I am new to Vpn's in general. I have installed datho vpn and set up a paid account but I don't know how to verify that it's working. Then I don't know the next step to ensure the vpn I set up is "securing" my IP address. I have tried many searches and all results brought me to out-of-date information or it didn't apply to the configuration of Raspberry pi 3 with osmc and datho Vpn. Is there anyone out there who can explain 
Hi, I am trying to install datho vpn on an android tv box, following this method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3pr6PHngHE I've managed to install datho and successfully logged in, but I seem to be stuck when it comes to selecting a location. I can select from a bunch of different locations and briefly see a "working" icon on the bottom of my screen and then nothing happens. If I try to connect to a blocked address, I get nowhere and if I look at my ip, it's still my own location. Thanks to everyone who downloaded our new VPN add-on when we released it last week ( The add-on is currently configured to work only with Datho VPN ( service, but we are busy changing all of that so that the add-on works with any VPN provider which supports OpenVPN. What we can officially. Greetings, I have Kodi on my fire stick and looking to use a VPN for the fire stick, without rooting. I figure I have to side loads some apps. I used Dathos VPN for andriod on my phone, but I cant seem to do it on the fire stick. Any guides available at the moment for the fire stick? Thanks. I have recently seen only 2 VPN providers who's addon is officially present on Kodi/XBMC player supported devices. Ivacy VPN (https://www.ivacy.com/kodi-vpn/) just recently introduced their VPN addon for Kodi and Datho VPN has been there for a while. But I want to know if you guys actually use a VPN for Kodi/XBMC. As in the title. Tried Datho VPN but couldn't 
So I got Datho VPN plugin for Kodi. However when I enable it, the vpn affects my whole computer. Is there a way to isolate it to only affect. I just recently installed KODI but I'm having issues with region-specific content. I've always used VPN in the past on other devices as a way around this but I'm totally new to all this XBMC/KODI stuff. I was looking at DathoVPN since that seems to be talked about most but if I'm going to pay for a service, I'd want it to be usable on all my devices (ipad, phone, hudl2), not just the one (Boxee) that runs Kodi. Unless I'm misunderstanding the Datho website. Very possible. What are my options. My colleague and I have put together a new online streaming sports pricing guide ( for VPN and Smart DNS users. As most of you know, VPN and smart DNS services allow us cordcutters to subscribe to streaming sports services such as NFL Game Pass, which are either not traditionally offered to users in North America, or are severely restricted (home game blackouts, for example. 
I'm trying to set up a VPN so that I can access more content, but it's the first time I've ever done this, and I'm completely lost. I started by looking into DathosVPN, and decided to give it a shot. Got it install on Kodi, but I needed another VPN for Dathos to access. So I installed OpenVPN, but I don't know how to configure this so that Dathos works with it. Any guidance would be great, because I don't have a clue where to continue. The problem I have it that when I try access content We are seeking approximately 20 beta-testers for a new VPN service and add-on designed specifically for use with XBMC. As a show of gratitude for your assistance, all selected beta-testers will receive 6-months free service to Datho Digital VPN if you wish to continue using it. We are especially keen to test this service on as many Android devices as possible, so candidates able to test on Android will be given priority. A beta-tester with a rooted Amazon Fire TV, is an particularly I recently get to know that Ivacy (https://www.ivacy.com/kodi-vpn/) has announced their VPN addon for Kodi, and Datho has been there for a while. But are there anymore VPNs which are supporting Kodi/XBMC on OpenELEC devices.
