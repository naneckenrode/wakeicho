A high-resolution camera can produce 2D and even 3D videos at high quality. But to have perfect videos, you must use a reliable software to make basic or advanced editing operations such as cut, paste, delete parts, add effects, convert.

I have a wifi backpack and want to update it but there is no longer a device window in GoPro Studio. Does anyone know if this is possible.

The big emphasis is free, i dont plan on paying for one so cineform works fine for what it does, i just was wondering whether or not there is a better free program.  Why Hollywood Bundle.

When ever I use CineForm, it doesnt fit my screen. It is "too large" for my screen and the sides ends up getting cut off so I can't see the entire program. I try to make it smaller but it refuses. I use Windows 7 and I just recently installed.

When i import new footage from the Hero3 Black Edition into Cineform Studio, the "Select Trim Points" feature disappears from the lower left of the program, and i can't cut/trim my footage before i convert it. This is only happening with Hero3 footage, I have older HeroHD footage that I can trim normally, can anyone confirm this or offer any suggestions please.

Apple ProRes is a high quality (although still lossy) video compression format developed by Apple Inc. for use in post-production that supports up to 8K. It is the successor of the Apple Intermediate Codec and was introduced in 2007 with Final Cut Studio. Hey everyone, why is it that I can plug the SD card from my GoPro into my laptop and VLC and media player etc. can play it just fine, but when I put the video through Cineform, it becomes unplayable? VLC doesnt recognize the sound format, and the film is slow and jumpy. Thanks. Whenever I try and use cineform studio the quality of the video that comes out on export seems to be noticeably pixilated compared with the raw protune footage. Am I doing something horribly wrong or is it something to do with the output codecs cineform uses? If anyone has any good tutorials I would I just got a Hero 3 Black and edit in Adobe Premiere on a Mac. I am trying to figure out the best workflow for the camera. A lot of people have said that they use the Cineform Studio to convert the mp4 to mov with the Cineform codec. I would like to do this but every time I convert using the Cineform Studio, it outputs a mov that has two videos side by side with some effects applied. Can Cineform Studio be used to output 2D video or is only used for converting to 3D? This seems like a stupi. I'm not sure if this is specific to Mac, I just happen to be using one right now. Latest version of Cineform Studio, latest version firmware for Hero 3 Black. Importing stills from a time-lapse, but once imported the 'sequence' won't appear in the main 'preview' window.I can use the transport controls and it moves the play head as if it's playing, but the preview area is just a black window. Any ideas. I'm having some problems using Cineform to convert my video. The program works great, when it works, but after a few conversions the program seems to break itself. It's hard to explain so I have posted a picture of the issue. I've tried googling it but I'm not sure what to look for. Any suggestions? In the photo notice on the left how the import screen is messed up and on the right the first conversion video is messed up. I was able to convert but I had to blindly click around trying to select. 
I somehow switched to the trial version of the software. I believe I may have done this when I manually download the software update when ProTune came out for the Hero2. How can I get my software back to the premium version. My cineform studio program literally crashes about everytime I use it, mainly when I'm trying to convert a clip. I literally cannot convert a 240 fps clip at all. Even if it's under 5 seconds. The program just freezes up and crashes. I would like some input to hear if you guys are having the same problems or have found a way around the problem. I'm running a PC that has 12gb ram and a decent video card. So my computer should not be the issue. I've been doing some reading and it sounds like other. Unfortunately my notebook is not suited for cine form studio. it always crashes when I try to convert.it looked like perfect software to edit out clips useful in production and delete all the crap shooting of mine:-) too bad its not running on my computer. any other software out there? Don't even need transcoding functionality and colour editing.just making short clips and save them without loss of quality. Thank. Hello, I recently purchased a Hero3 White and have been fooling around with it and CineForm studio. I see that the White model does not have ProTune mode. Now, I am pretty new to cameras and couldn't get my head around what any of the descriptions of ProTune actually mean. However, I do see that in CineForm studio, I can select a ProTune mode that really seems to enhance some of the color in my videos. Should I use this if I have the white model, or is it meant more for the other models?. I did my first time lapse today of the sunset. I have a hero 3 silver and it is my first time ever editing a video. I want to know how to make the 18 minutes of the time lapse speed up. I have looked online but can't find anything. It may just be my computer but I cannot figure this out. Thanks. 
When i first import videos from my camera to Cineform Studio in 1080, 60 FPS, the video stutters. I believe this is due to my computer maybe not being powerful enough. (30 fps same resolution works perfectly). My question is if i can still use the footage after exporting it and editing it. Will it stutter all the way through editing and in the final video. Hey guys, I had a quick question about converting clips in Cineform. I'm converting a 720 60 FPS clip from my hero 2, the question I have is: In advanced settings should I change the framerate? Would this better the quality at all? Later on I'm going to vary the speed (some parts fast, some parts slow) if that matters. If it helps, I'd like the quality to be as crisp/smooth as possible. Thanks for any advice! I'm new to Cineform and I haven't found any good tutorials on YouTube. EDIT: I might just be being dumb but I've taken a short series of stills to be compiled into a time lapse video, but despite them being named in ascending numbered order in which they were taken, Cineform Studio still seems to be messing them up somewhere. Like 90% are in the correct order, but then every 24th frame or so it's pasted in an image from a different section. Any ideas. After step one when I import and convert, even without making any edits when I move on to step two for some reason the video shows up white and only with sound. I've tried looking up the reason to this and the only thing I was able to find was that the video might be to long. After I found out about that I made the video shorter, but it still showed up white on step two with the same exact problem. What do you guys think/know the problem is? EDIT Finally found my answer! (sorta) I still. I recently posted this inquiry and sample video, ( and I got enough feed back to where I would like to put together the entire hour video. Issue is, the one other time I tried this, I seemingly lost some of my footage even though I went through the identical process I use for my shorter videos. I simply use the Cineform Studio GoPro program, and then drop my footage into Windows Movie Maker.
